# React Food Tracker

This is a food-tracking web app built using React. The user may input multiple days into the food tracker. For each day, the user may enter what foods they ate on that day. The tracker will report some statistics on what foods have been eaten, such as the average calories per day. 

To run the tracker, download the project and open in VS Code. Make sure you have Node.js installed. Open a terminal and run the following command:
npm start

This will open the tracker in your default browser.

Note: You may get the following error when running npm start:
  'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.
  
In this case, run the following command:
npm update

Then run npm start again to load the food tracker.
